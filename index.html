    <h1>webtra.sh - A worklog for my casual grind</h1>
    <h2>Meta and Contact</h2>
    <p>I am using this to track things I do in support of my startup idea POC/first implementation. Everything is fast and loose, so this will be as well.</p>

    <p>You may see that this blog is hosted at a personal domain. If it's not clear what that domain is, it's featured prominently in the name of this blog. Email the account "blog" that's hosted there, and you should be able to get in touch with me. I'm open to most communication.</p>

    <h2>22 October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Setup site to host work log via GitHub pages.</li>
      <li>Configure webtra.sh domain to (hopefully) work properly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>21 October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure SSH, launch (single, without success check), and
      enumerate VMs on Digital Ocean via API from Python.</li>
