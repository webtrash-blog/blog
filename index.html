    <h2>Meta and Contact</h2>
    <p>
      I am using this to track things I do in support of my startup
      idea POC/first implementation. Everything is fast and loose, so
      this will be as well.</p>

      You may see that this blog is hosted at a personal domain. If
      it's not clear what that domain is, it's featured prominently in
      the name of this blog. Email the account "blog" that's hosted
      there, and you should be able to get in touch with me. I'm open
      to most communication.</p>
    
    <h2>22 October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Setup site to host work log via GitHub pages (hopefully... not
	working via the GitHub URL at the moment).</li>
      <li>
	Configure webtra.sh domain to (hopefully) work properly, as
	the DNS service had to be stolen from an old host.</li>
      <li>
	Implement creation polling and destruction on Digital
	Ocean</li>
      <li>
	Implement command-line features. Easy to go too far here, but
	really I'm just interested in being able to start up a swarm
	of VMs without any fuss. Maybe the last feature I would want
	is a list of hostnames or IP addresses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Next place to start: Ansible playbooks for configuring
      hosts.</p>

    <h2>21 October 2023</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Configure SSH, launch (single, without success check), and
	enumerate VMs on Digital Ocean via API from Python.</li>
    </ul>
